Based on our discussions and the components we've developed, here's a comprehensive prompt and set of requirements for the generative storytelling application:

Prompt:
Develop a generative storytelling application that leverages concepts from complex systems modeling, particularly drawing inspiration from protein folding prediction systems. The application should generate coherent, constrained narratives represented as directed graphs, allowing for dynamic user interaction and story exploration.

Requirements:

1. Core Data Structures:
   - Implement StoryNode, StoryEdge, and NarrativeGraph structures to represent the story elements and overall narrative structure.
   - Develop a NarrativeState class to track the current state of the story, including variables and character arcs.

2. Narrative Generation:
   - Create a story generation algorithm that produces coherent narratives while adhering to specified constraints.
   - Implement a Markov State Model approach for transitioning between narrative states.
   - Develop an energy function to evaluate narrative coherence and interest.

3. Constraints and Rules:
   - Implement a constraint system that allows for the definition and enforcement of narrative rules (e.g., character arcs, plot structures).
   - Create a CharacterArcConstraint class to ensure character development follows predefined patterns.

4. User Interaction:
   - Develop an interface for users to interact with and influence the narrative as it unfolds.
   - Implement dynamic graph updates based on user choices and input.
   - Create a system for users to define custom constraints or story parameters.

5. Visualization:
   - Implement functions to visualize the narrative graph using a library like Graphviz.
   - Create an energy landscape visualization to represent the story's progression and potential branches.

6. Advanced Features:
   - Implement "sink state" detection to identify potential story endings.
   - Develop a system for procedurally generating new story elements based on user input and current narrative state.
   - Create an adaptive storytelling mechanism that learns from user preferences to personalize the narrative experience.

7. Performance and Scalability:
   - Ensure the application can handle large, complex narrative graphs efficiently.
   - Implement optimizations for graph traversal and state transitions.

8. Testing and Validation:
   - Develop a comprehensive test suite to validate the correctness of the narrative generation and constraint enforcement.
   - Implement methods to evaluate the quality and coherence of generated stories.

9. Documentation and Usability:
   - Provide clear documentation for all major components and algorithms.
   - Create a user guide explaining how to interact with the system and define custom story elements.

10. Integration and Extensibility:
    - Design the system with modularity in mind, allowing for easy integration of new constraint types, generation algorithms, or visualization methods.
    - Implement a plugin system for users to add custom story elements or generation rules.

11. Ethical Considerations:
    - Implement content filtering or flagging system to handle potentially sensitive or inappropriate content.
    - Ensure user data privacy and provide options for anonymized story generation.

Technical Specifications:
- Implement the core system in Rust for performance and safety.
- Use appropriate data structures (e.g., HashMaps, Vectors) for efficient story representation and manipulation.
- Leverage multithreading for parallel processing of complex narrative generation tasks.
- Utilize a graph database for storing and querying large narrative structures.
- Implement a RESTful API for potential web or mobile front-end integration.

The final application should provide a rich, interactive storytelling experience that balances author-defined narrative structures with user-driven exploration and customization. It should be capable of generating diverse, coherent stories while adhering to specified constraints and adapting to user preferences.
