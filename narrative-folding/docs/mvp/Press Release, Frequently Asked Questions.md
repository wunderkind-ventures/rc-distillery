"Narrative Architect is not just another writing tool; it's a quantum leap in story structure design," said Jane Doe, CEO of StoryTech Inc.

Key features of Narrative Architect include:
- Interactive narrative graph visualization
- Customizable constraint systems for story structure
- Real-time story validation and coherence scoring
- AI-assisted story element generation
- Collaborative editing and version control

Narrative Architect is available now for professional and enterprise users, with plans starting at $19.99 per month. A free trial is available for all new users.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: What makes Narrative Architect different from other story planning tools?**

A: Narrative Architect stands out with its unique approach inspired by protein folding prediction systems. It offers a dynamic, visual representation of story structures as complex networks, allows for the definition and application of sophisticated narrative constraints, and provides real-time feedback on story coherence and "energy levels." The AI-assisted generation and validation features are unparalleled in the industry.

**Q: Who is the target audience for Narrative Architect?**

A: Narrative Architect is designed for professional writers, game designers, narrative directors, writing educators, and serious hobbyists. It's particularly valuable for those working on complex, multi-layered narratives or interactive storytelling projects.

**Q: How does the constraint system work?**

A: Users can choose from predefined constraint templates (like the Hero's Journey or Three-Act Structure) or create custom constraints. These constraints are visually represented on the narrative graph and can be applied to specific story elements or the entire structure. The system continuously checks the narrative against these constraints, providing real-time feedback and suggestions.

**Q: Can Narrative Architect generate entire stories?**

A: While Narrative Architect includes AI-assisted generation features, it's not designed to write complete stories autonomously. Instead, it suggests potential story elements, plot points, and narrative paths that fit within the defined structure and constraints, serving as a creative aid rather than a replacement for human creativity.

**Q: How does the collaboration feature work?**

A: Multiple users can work on the same narrative structure simultaneously, with changes synced in real-time. The version control system allows for branching and merging of different story versions, making it easy to explore alternative narrative paths or revert changes.

**Q: Is my work in Narrative Architect secure and private?**

A: Yes, we take data security and privacy seriously. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Users have full control over their projects and can choose to keep them private or share them with specific collaborators.

**Q: Can Narrative Architect integrate with other writing or game development tools?**

A: Yes, we offer an API for integration with popular writing software and game engines. We're continuously expanding our integration options based on user feedback and industry partnerships.

**Q: How does pricing work for Narrative Architect?**

A: We offer tiered pricing plans:
- Individual: $19.99/month
- Professional: $49.99/month (includes advanced AI features and priority support)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (includes on-premises deployment options and dedicated support)
All plans come with a 30-day free trial.

**Q: Is there a learning curve for using Narrative Architect?**

A: While Narrative Architect offers sophisticated features, we've designed the interface to be intuitive and user-friendly. The application includes an interactive tutorial system and contextual help. Most users become proficient with the basic features within a few hours of use.

**Q: How often is Narrative Architect updated?**

A: We release minor updates and bug fixes bi-weekly, with major feature updates quarterly. Our development roadmap is influenced by user feedback, and we regularly engage with our community to prioritize new features and improvements.
