Based on the search results and our previous discussions, here are the key features that should be included in the generative storytelling application:

1. Interactive Narrative Graph:
   - Implement a directed graph structure to represent the story, with nodes as story events/states and edges as transitions.
   - Allow users to visualize and interact with the narrative graph, similar to the graph-centered approach mentioned in result [5].

2. AI-Powered Story Generation:
   - Utilize advanced AI models (like RNNs or Transformers) to generate coherent narrative elements and plot progressions.
   - Implement an energy function to evaluate narrative coherence and interest, as discussed in our previous conversations.

3. Constraint System:
   - Develop a flexible constraint system that allows users to define and enforce narrative rules (e.g., character arcs, plot structures).
   - Implement character arc constraints to ensure character development follows predefined patterns.

4. User Interaction and Input:
   - Create an interface for users to interact with and influence the narrative as it unfolds, as mentioned in result [1].
   - Allow users to input initial parameters such as genre, setting, main characters, and themes.

5. Multimodal Interaction:
   - Incorporate various input methods, including traditional interfaces, physiological inputs, and potentially even brain-computer interfaces for a more immersive experience, as suggested in result [1].

6. Adaptive Storytelling:
   - Implement a system that learns from user preferences to personalize the narrative experience over time.
   - Use AI to analyze user behavior and adjust the story accordingly, as mentioned in result [3].

7. Real-time Content Generation:
   - Develop capabilities for generating story elements and adapting the narrative in real-time based on user interactions, as discussed in result [3].

8. Visualization Tools:
   - Create interactive visualizations of the narrative structure, character relationships, and story progression.
   - Implement tools for visualizing the "energy landscape" of the story, showing potential paths and outcomes.

9. Martini Glass Structure:
   - Design the storytelling flow to follow a "martini glass" structure, starting with a guided narrative before opening up for free exploration, as mentioned in result [4].

10. Data Integration and Analysis:
    - Incorporate tools for analyzing and visualizing story-related data, such as character interactions, plot developments, and thematic elements.
    - Use data storytelling techniques to present this information to users, as discussed in result [6].

11. Collaborative Features:
    - Allow multiple users to collaborate on story creation and exploration.
    - Implement version control and branching for collaborative storytelling.

12. Export and Sharing:
    - Provide options to export generated stories in various formats (text, visual novel, interactive web page, etc.).
    - Implement sharing features for users to distribute their created narratives.

13. Natural Language Processing:
    - Integrate NLP capabilities for analyzing user-generated content and incorporating it into the story.
    - Use NLP for more natural interactions between the user and the storytelling system.

14. Ethical Considerations:
    - Implement content filtering or flagging systems to handle potentially sensitive or inappropriate content.
    - Ensure user data privacy and provide options for anonymized story generation.

These features combine the technical aspects of our previous discussions with insights from the search results, creating a comprehensive and innovative generative storytelling application that balances AI-driven narrative generation with user interaction and customization.
