<p> As a writer, I want to visualize my narrative structure so that I can see how different story elements connect and interact. </p>
<p> Acceptance Criteria: <br>
2.1.1.1 The narrative graph updates in real-time as I add nodes and edges. <br>
2.1.1.2 I can click on nodes to view details such as content and metadata. <br>
2.1.1.3 I can drag and drop nodes to rearrange them without losing connections. </p>

#### 2.1.2: User Story: 
<p> As a game designer, I want to apply constraints to my narrative so that I can ensure it follows established storytelling rules. </p>
<p> Acceptance Criteria: <br>
2.1.2.1 I can select predefined constraints or create custom ones. <br>
2.1.2.2 The system alerts me if I violate any defined constraints when generating a narrative. <br>
2.1.2.3 I can view a list of all constraints applied to the current narrative. <br>
</p>

#### 2.1.3: User Story: 
<p> As a game developer, I want the system to generate story elements based on player interactions so that I can create engaging and dynamic narratives. </p>
<p> Acceptance Criteria: <br>
2.1.3.1 The system generates dialogue and plot points based on current narrative context. <br>
2.1.3.2 Generated content aligns with the constraints set by the user. <br>
2.1.3.3 I can modify generated content to better fit my vision. <br>

This diagram shows the following components and their relationships:
### Frontend:
- User Interface: The main interface for user interactions
- Visualization Engine: Renders the narrative graph
- Graph Editor: Allows users to modify the narrative structure
### Backend:
- API Server: Handles all requests from the frontend
- Authentication Service: Manages user authentication and authorization
- Constraint Engine: Processes and enforces narrative constraints
- AI Story Generator: Generates story elements and content
- Graph Processing Engine: Handles graph-related computations
### Data Storage:
- Database: Stores narrative structures, user data, and constraints
- Cache: Improves performance by caching frequent queries
### External Services:
- External AI Service: For advanced NLP tasks or additional AI capabilities
- Integration APIs: For exporting/importing data to other tools

### Flow of Data and Interactions:
The arrows show the flow of data and interactions between components. This architecture allows for scalability, separation of concerns, and integration with external services. 
The frontend communicates with the backend via the API server, which then coordinates with various backend services to process requests, generate content, and manage data.
