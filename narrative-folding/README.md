# Narrative Folding

Narrative Folding is a framework for creating and analyzing narrative structures in text data. It provides a modular architecture for defining and checking constraints on narrative structures, as well as a variety of visualization and analysis tools.

This was inspired by the applications of Markov State Models within the prediction of protein folds/structures and a conversation with [@shenai](shenaiwc@gmail.com).

## Features

- **Constraint-Based Narrative Analysis**: Define and check constraints on narrative structures.
- **State and Graph Management**: Manage narrative states and graphs for analysis.
- **Energy-Based Sampling**: Use energy-based sampling for efficient narrative generation.
- **Sink Detection**: Detect and handle sinks in narrative structures.
- **Visualization**: Visualize narrative structures and constraints.
- **Generation**: Generate narratives using energy-based sampling.

## Getting Started

To get started with Narrative Folding, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
